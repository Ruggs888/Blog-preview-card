## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build a small blog card, the assets are given and the rest is up to you to get it close to the design as possible. The user should be able to see hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Mobile first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first finished project with HTML/CSS. I've worked on some simple websites but never finished anything. I learned a lot about styling in css, and how to seperate elements in HTML so that they can be styled seperately.

### Continued development

I am curious as to what the best practice is for seperating elements in HTML, if it's using divs to seperate the areas I want to style, when to use span, and other elements to achieve the most efficient product which will come in handy in the long run.
